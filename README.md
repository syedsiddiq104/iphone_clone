# iphone_clone
This is a responsive front-end clone of the Apple iPhone website, built using HTML, CSS, and less JS but the design is different from actual and the animations and effect which make u feel more appeal. The project replicates the look and feel of Apple's product showcase, including interactive navigation, smooth animations.
